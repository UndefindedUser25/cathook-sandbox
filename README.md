# Cathook under a sandbox
This repo is to prove that you can sandbox under linux. Firejail is the core feature of catbots so why not replicate catbots but with TF2 GUI and shitty FPS?

## coming soon
i'll figure out a way to firejail and cathook attach to work properly. might have to rewrite the attach script sigh
